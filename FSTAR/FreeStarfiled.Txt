Hi dudes!
Well, no much to say....the title is self-explanatory :)
The added 2 .exe you'll find are for the ones that can't compile the source.

 	Fs.exe 	is the standard exe
	bFs.exe is intended to be used for benchmarking.
	sFs.exe will display the angulat coordinates ad velocity

On my K6-233 it flies at 160 fps, using 2500 stars, and at 115 ca. using 4000 stars.

See ya!
