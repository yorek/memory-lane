The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) was developed by David Wheeler and
Roger Needham at the Computer Laboratory of Cambridge University.
The variant used was developed by David Wagner
Thanks to Ross N. Williams for his tutorial on CRC32
Thanks to Billy Bryan for his suggestion on optimization.


	teacrypt {commands} {sourcefile} {destfile} [parameters]

  Available commands:
    c		Crypt {sourcefile} to {destfile}
    d		Decrypt {sourcefile} to {destfile}

  Available parameters:
    -k{x}={y}	Keys. If {x} is a number from 1 to 4 you have to specify the
    		4 {y} keys manually. Each keys has to be a 32bit integer value.
    		If you use 'kf' you have to specify a file which will be used
    		as key.
    -v		Be verbose
    -o		Use original de-encryption algorithm, which is a (very) little
    		less secure
    -n={x}	Number of de-encryption cycles.
    		{x} can be any number from 0 up to 255 
    		Default is {x}=16 which is a good compromise between security
    		and speed.
    		{x}=32 is for high security, x={0} is for no encryption  

  Crypt Examples:
    		teacrypt c readme.txt readme.tdf -k1=10 -k2=20 -k3=30 -k4=40  
    		teacrypt c readme.txt readme.tdf -kf=key.jpg  

  Decrypt Examples:
    		teacrypt d readme.tdf readme_dec.txt -k1=10 -k2=20 -k3=30 -k4=40  
    		teacrypt d readme.tdf readme_dec.txt -kf=key.jpg
