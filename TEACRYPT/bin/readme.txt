"What is the Tiny Encryption Algorithm?
The Tiny Encryption Algorithm is one of the fastest and most efficient cryptographic algorithms in existence. It was developed by David Wheeler and Roger Needham at the Computer Laboratory of Cambridge University. It is a Feistel cipher which uses operations from mixed (orthogonal) algebraic groups - XORs and additions in this case. It encrypts 64 data bits at a time using a 128-bit key. It seems highly resistant to differential cryptanalysis, and achieves complete diffusion (where a one bit difference in the plaintext will cause approximately 32 bit differences in the ciphertext) after only six rounds. Performance on a modern desktop computer or workstation is very impressive. 

You can obtain a copy of Roger Needham and David Wheeler's original paper describing TEA, from the Security Group ftp site at the world-famous Cambridge Computer Laboratory at Cambridge University. There's also a paper on extended variants of TEA which addresses a couple of minor weaknesses (irrelevant in almost all real-world applications), and introduces a block variant of the algorithm which can be even faster in some circumstances.
