Fractal Mania !
(c) 1998 Davide Mauri.

Just one thing: /? for help.
No more to say...go and watch!

If you want make a comparison on my K6-233Mhz the program (in the standard
mode, so with no parameter passed, and in PLAIN Dos), after 30 seconds,
reaches 227 fps!

Ok...See ya!


History
-------

v1.0
	The first version, nothing less and nothing more.

v1.1
	/w parameter now call a routine that draws the fractal with more
        accurate precision and renders the largest possible area, which
        is 200x200 pixel. Despite of the amount of math required, on my
        K6-233 it reaches 100fps.
        So remember: /w will not wait for the Vertical Redraw anymore.

v1.2
        /j parameter added. This will render the Julibrot set, which show
        the julia and the madeldrot set joined togheter...very cool to see
        ...this can show how julia and mandel are strictly related.

v1.2b	Some little adjustements in code. 
	Leaved any kind of aliases and used my real name.
